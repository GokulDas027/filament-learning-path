# 3D rendering

In the previous section, we've learned the basics and rendered a 2D triangle. This is a continuation, only let's go 3D this time. This section too will be based on the filament sample apps, and before diving in, we need a little Math, about Quaternions. 

Here are some resources about Quaternions 
* [Visualizing quaternions - An explorable video series](https://eater.net/quaternions)
* [Visualizing quaternions (4d numbers) with stereographic projection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg)
* [Quaternions and 3d rotation, explained interactively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ)

Yeah, all of them are from 3blue1brown, first place I look for Math.


... i'm learning the math ...

btw, let's look into the [LitCube](https://github.com/google/filament/blob/ca3b84197441e351ef490d61cbae14ef661a1bbe/android/samples/sample-lit-cube/src/main/java/com/google/android/filament/litcube/MainActivity.kt) this time.

Since now we know the basics, most of the code for litCube are already familiar to us, take a deep look into it.

There are a few additional things to note here, 
* We now have a directional light, and turns out, Light too is an Entity, like the renderable. Light is created into an Entity using the `LightManager` and is added to the scene. Again, like the renderable.
* Using a new material for the object, since the scene is now directionally lit, unlike the Hello Triangle where the scene wasn't and triangle was 2D.
* The Vertex data for the Cube contains positions and tangents. Still trying to figure it out, Quaternions.

### Light Manager
> LightManager allows you to create a light source in the scene, such as a sun or street lights.
> At least one light must be added to a scene in order to see anything (unless the Material.Shading.UNLIT is used). 
> 
> A Light component is created using the LightManager.Builder and destroyed by calling destroy(int). 
> Lights come in three flavors:
> * directional lights
>   > Directional lights have a direction, but don't have a position. All light rays are parallel and come from infinitely far away and from everywhere. Typically a directional light is used to simulate the sun. 
> * point lights
>   > Unlike directional lights, point lights have a position but emit light in all directions. The intensity of the light diminishes with the inverse square of the distance to the light.
> * spot lights
>   > Spot lights are similar to point lights but the light they emit is limited to a cone defined by LightManager.Builder.spotLightCone(float, float) and the light's direction.
