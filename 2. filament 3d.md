# 3D rendering

In the previous section, we've learned the basics and rendered a 2D triangle. This is a continuation, only let's go 3D this time. This section too will be based on the filament sample apps, and before diving in, we need a little Math, about Quaternions. 

Here are some resources about Quaternions 
* [Visualizing quaternions - An explorable video series](https://eater.net/quaternions)
* [Visualizing quaternions (4d numbers) with stereographic projection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg)
* [Quaternions and 3d rotation, explained interactively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ)

Yeah, all of them are from 3blue1brown, first place I look for Math.


... i'm learning the math ...

btw, let's look into the [LitCube](https://github.com/google/filament/blob/ca3b84197441e351ef490d61cbae14ef661a1bbe/android/samples/sample-lit-cube/src/main/java/com/google/android/filament/litcube/MainActivity.kt) this time.

Since now we know the basics, most of the code for litCube are already familiar to us, take a deep look into it.

There are a few additional things to note here, 
* We now have a directional light, and turns out, <u>Light too is an Entity</u>, like the renderable. Light is created into an Entity using the `LightManager` and is added to the scene. Again, like the renderable.
* Using a new material for the object, since the scene is now directionally lit, unlike the Hello Triangle where the scene wasn't directionally lit and triangle was 2D.
* The Vertex data for the Cube contains positions and tangents. Still trying to figure it out, Quaternions.
