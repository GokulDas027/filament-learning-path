# Filament Basics

Filament is a real-time physically based rendering engine. Physically based rendering (PBR) is a computer graphics approach that seeks to render images in a way that models the flow of light in the real world. Essentially it means, Filament rendering is highly performant and focuses on keeping the renderings look as natural as possible.

## Filament Rendering components

### Engine
As defined in filaments code, 
> An Engine instance main function is to keep track of all resources created by the user and manage the rendering thread as well as the hardware renderer. 

In my words, Engine manages the whole View, it's components(Scene, Renderer, Objects, Lighting, etc), handles asset loading and resource usage.

### Renderer
> A Renderer instance represents an operating system's window. Typically, applications create a Renderer per window. The Renderer generates drawing commands for the render thread and manages frame latency.
A Renderer generates drawing commands from a View, itself containing a Scene description. 

It draws the Scene on the OS's window as per the view

### View
> Encompasses all the state needed for rendering a Scene. View instances are heavy objects that internally cache a lot of data needed for rendering. 
 
The View contains everything required for rendering a scene, which includes, the Scene itself, Camera, ViewPort and some other rendering parameters.

### Scene
> A Scene is a flat container of RenderableManager and LightManager components.
 
It manages the Lighting and Objects.

### Camera
> Camera represents the eye through which the scene is viewed.A Camera has a position and orientation and controls the projection and exposure parameters. 

Camera represents the perception through which the scene is viewed.


## Android Kotlin Code Snippets
Activity onCreate

```
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
    engine = Engine.create()
    renderer = engine.createRenderer()
    scene = engine.createScene()
    view = engine.createView()
    camera = engine.createCamera(engine.entityManager.create())
}
```

Activity onDestory
```
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()

    // Cleanup all resources
    engine.destroyRenderer(renderer)
    engine.destroyView(view)
    engine.destroyScene(scene)
    engine.destroyCameraComponent(camera.entity)
    
    // Engine.destroyEntity() destroys Filament related resources only
    // (components), not the entity itself

    // Destroying the engine will free up any resource you may have forgotten
    // to destroy, but it's recommended to do the cleanup properly
    engine.destroy()
}
```

### SwapChain
> A SwapChain represents an Operating System's native renderable surface. Typically it's a native window or a view. Because a SwapChain is initialized from a native object, it is given to filament as an Object, which must be of the proper type for each platform filament is running on.
For Android the native window object must be of type [Surface](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Surface).

Create swapchain using the filament Engine instance

`swapChain = engine.createSwapChain(surface, uiHelper.swapChainFlags)`

`uiHelper.swapChainFlags` provides the flags about configurations set on the UiHelper instance(android only helper to manage surface view).

> info: Swapchain can be created and destroyed with help of uiHelper render callbacks.
> info: Swapchain is later passed to renderer to init a new frame.

### UiHelper
> UiHelper is a simple class that can manage either a SurfaceView, TextureView, or a SurfaceHolder so it can be used to render into with Filament.

It provides callbacks(UiHelper.RenderCallback) on native window changes, on detachment and on resize. After attaching surface view, must detach on destroy. Also check if view is ready to render.

### DisplayHelper
> DisplayHelper is here to help managing a Display, for instance being notified when its resolution or refresh rate changes.

Attach the display and assosiated renderer, to receive display config changes.
