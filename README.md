Filament Android Code docs

I'm new to filament, and filament doesn't have much learning resources available, so here i'm documenting everything as i understand, on the go..

## [Filament](https://github.com/google/filament) 
Filament is a real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, and WebGL2. Though, here we are focusing on Android development in Kotlin. In depth documentation about filament and the underlying principles is available [here](https://google.github.io/filament/)

What particularly interests me into filament is to use it as renderer with ArCore for Android apps.
